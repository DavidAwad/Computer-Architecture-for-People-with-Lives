# Computer Architecture For People With Lives

This is a small booklet comprising the basics of Computer Architecture, Systems Programming, and Operating Systems.

Ideally this could serve as a convenient reference for someone taking courses related to these topics who doesn't understand how some of these isolated topics work. 

|Topics          | Summary|
|:-------------: | :-----:|
| [Computer Architecture](https://github.com/DavidAwad/Computer-Architecture-for-People-with-Lives/blob/master/Computer-Architecture/Overview.md) | The basics of Low Level programming, and the design of a computer | 
| [Systems Programming](https://github.com/DavidAwad/Computer-Architecture-for-People-with-Lives/blob/master/Systems-Programming/Overview.md)  | Get used to writing complex C programs that can use the processor to it's limits |
| [Operating Systems](https://github.com/DavidAwad/Computer-Architecture-for-People-with-Lives/blob/master/Operating-Systems/Overview.md)  | Read about how the Kernel uses hardware to isolate processes and manage filesystems in virtual memory! |

I hope to write this book in my spare time over the coming summer to enhance my own understanding and make these low level topics of computer science more accessible to the average monkey.



#### *disclaimer*  

##### I don't have a PhD in computer science, this book is simply meant to serve as a formal compilation of my notes from taking these three low level courses and provide a convenient series of code examples. As it can be kind of annoying to not be able to find simple examples of how some things work.
