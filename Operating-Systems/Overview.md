# Operating Systems 

Typically most schools use an operating systems course to talk about the kernel, which is used as a fundamental bridge between the operating system and the hardware. 


| Topic | Summary |  
|:-------------:|:-----:|
| System Calls | How to make calls to the kernel |  
| Virtual Memory  | How virtual memory is translated to physical memory addresses when the kernel reads or writes to memory from disk |
| Signals  | The basics behind Traps, Exceptions, and Interrupts |  
| Disk Writing Algorithms | The basics of how disk chooses to deal with things like queues of  write requests  |
| Filesystems | those inodes from before! But worse. |
| Security | The basics of computer security |



This will be divided into TBA
