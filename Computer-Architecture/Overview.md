# Computer Architecture

So this is the beginning chapter where ideally we'll be able to get a grasp for how a computer works beyond just our programs. 


This segment ideally would be broken into a couple of sections. 

| Topic | Summary |  
|:-------------: | :-----:|
| Modern Machines  | Computer Design, from the ground up. |
| C  | Basics of Programming in C |  
| Assembly | Instruction Set Architecture |
| CPU Design And Architecture  | stages of execution, basic CPU organization, single-cycle and multiple-cycle designs, microprogramming vs. hardwired control, interrupts	|
| Circuits |  Basic Digital Logic Design  |
