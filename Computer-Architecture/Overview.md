# Computer Architecture

So this is the beginning chapter where ideally we'll be able to get a grasp for how a computer works beyond just our programs. 


This segment ideally would be broken into a couple of sections. 

| Topic | Summary |  
|:-------------: | :-----:|
| [Modern Machines](https://github.com/DavidAwad/Computer-Architecture-for-People-with-Lives/blob/master/Computer-Architecture/Machines.md)  | Computer Design, from the ground up. |
| [C](https://github.com/DavidAwad/Computer-Architecture-for-People-with-Lives/blob/master/Computer-Architecture/C.md)  | Basics of Programming in C |
| Assembly | The basics behind different processors, and the different types of Instruction Set Architecture |
| CPU Design And Architecture  | stages of execution, basic CPU organization, single-cycle and multiple-cycle designs, microprogramming vs. hardwired control, interrupts	|
| Caches | How we use caches to keep information as close to the processor as possible |
| Circuits |  Basic Digital Logic Design  |
