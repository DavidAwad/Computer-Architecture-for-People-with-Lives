# The Modern Computer

So this is our first chapter, an introduction to how a typical machine works. 


Let's start with the literal. 


Your computer has a couple of fundamental pieces. Most of this should be straightforward but... whatever. 

So as a programmer, these are the parts of the computer that matter to you. 


| Parts |  |
|:-------:|:------:|
| Central Processing Unit | The Processor, basically the way your computer does all the math. | 
| Hard Drive | The place where all of your information is stored |
| **RAM** | Random Access Memory, basically a faster hard drive |

Intel and AMD are the largest CPU manufacturers for PCs, though you'll find others on the market, too. The two common CPU architectures are 32-bit and 64-bit, and you'll find that certain software relies on this architecture distinction.
